/**
 * @brief The BufferManager is responsible for:
 * 1. Pooled Buffers: preallocated fixed-size buffers of memory that must be reference counted
 * 2. Unpooled Buffers: variable sized buffers that are allocated on-the-fly. They are also subject to reference
 * counting.
 *
 * The reference counting mechanism of the TupleBuffer is explained in TupleBuffer.hpp
 *
 * The BufferManager stores the pooled buffers as MemorySegment-s. When a component asks for a Pooled buffer,
 * then the BufferManager retrieves an available buffer (it blocks the calling thread, if no buffer is available).
 * It then hands out a TupleBuffer that is constructed through the pointer stored inside a MemorySegment.
 * This is necessary because the BufferManager must keep all buffers stored to ensure that when its
 * destructor is called, all buffers that it has ever created are deallocated. Note the BufferManager will check also
 * that no reference counter is non-zero and will throw a fatal exception, if a component hasnt returned every buffers.
 * This is necessary to avoid memory leaks.
 *
 * Unpooled buffers are either allocated on the spot or served via a previously allocated, unpooled buffer that has
 * been returned to the BufferManager by some component.
 *
 * Debug-only marker fill: in debug builds the pooled memory area is prefilled with the ASCII pattern "NEBUSTRM"
 * (repeated). This turns code paths that rely on freshly-allocated buffers being zeroed into visible bugs
 * (e.g. a sink that forgets to trim by the formatted byte count will emit "NEBUSTRM..." trailing garbage
 * instead of silently passing thanks to an implicit zero terminator). When debugging a buffer-handling
 * issue, grep dumps/logs for "NEBUSTRM" or 0x4D5254535542454E to spot reads of uninitialized buffer memory.

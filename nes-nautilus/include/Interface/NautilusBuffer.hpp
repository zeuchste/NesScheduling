/// A NautilusBuffer is a Wrapper around a TupleBuffer. It can come in two different flavours:
/// 1. The BorrowedNautilusBuffer requires that an instance of a TupleBuffer is kept alive outside the nautilus execution. This handle
///    should be accessed by a single thread, as the handle itself is not Threadsafe. A common use case for the Borrowed variant
///    is the initial entry point into the nautilus pipeline which holds the TupleBuffer on the WorkerThreads stack.
///    If these two things can be guaranteed, you should prefer the BorrowedNautilusBuffer, as it does not require additional buffer
///    lifetime management
/// 2. The OwnedNautilusBuffer is allocated within the nautilus execution, and the lifetime is managed by the nautilus execution.
///    A common usecase is keeping a TupleBuffer alive which was allocated in a `nautilus::invoke` or loaded as a child of a different buffer:
///    ```c++
///    OwnedNautilusBuffer owned;
///    nautilus::invoke(+[](AbstractBufferProvider* provider, TupleBuffer* owned){
///         *owned = provider->getBufferBlocking();
///    }, provider, owned.asArg());
///    /// owned keeps the buffer alive, and releases once it goes out of scope
///    ```
/// APIs should be designed to be agnostic to the ownership of a buffer: `NautilusBuffer` is a type-erased variant that can hold both owned
/// and not owned that should be used most of the time.

/**
 * @brief This class will expand the logical query graph by adding information about the physical sources and expand the
 * graph by adding additional replicated operators.
 *
 * Note: Apart from replicating the logical source operator we also replicate its down stream operators till we
 * encounter first blocking operator as defined by method @see LogicalSourceExpansionRule:isBlockingOperator.
 *
 * Note: if expandSourceOnly is set to true then only source operators will be expanded and @see LogicalSourceExpansionRule:isBlockingOperator
 * will be ignored.
 *
 * Example: a query :                       Sink
 *                                           |
 *                                           Map
 *                                           |
 *                                        Source(Car)
 *
 * will be expanded to:                            Sink
 *                                                /     \
 *                                              /        \
 *                                           Map1        Map2
 *                                           |             |
 *                                      Source(Car1)    Source(Car2)
 *
 *
 * Given that logical source car has two physical sources: i.e. car1 and car2
 *
 *                                                     or
 *
 * a query :                                    Sink
 *                                               |
 *                                             Merge
 *                                             /   \
 *                                            /    Filter
 *                                          /        |
 *                                   Source(Car)   Source(Truck)
 *
 * will be expanded to:                             Sink
 *                                                   |
 *                                                 Merge
 *                                              /  / \   \
 *                                            /  /    \    \

/// @brief A rewrite stage that sets the FieldMappingTrait to prevent read-write conflicts inside a single projection.
/// This phase on its own does not change anything in the execution of the query, the lowering needs to use the FieldMappingTrait.
///
/// Without this stage, the following code would yield the wrong result:
/// @code{sql}
/// SELECT attr1 + 1 as attr1, attr1 + attr2 as attr2 FROM r
/// @endcode
/// This is, because in our execution engine we would write the attr1 value in place and then use that just written value in the second read.
///
/// This stage detects these conflicts and redirects conflicting writes to other field names.
/// These alternative field names are then propagated through the plan only over the field mapping trait, WITHOUT changing the operators themselves.
